# Practical 07

## About This Repository
This repository contains practical projects for learning Python programming, focusing on clean code, iterative development, and problem-solving techniques. Each project is designed to enhance understanding of programming concepts, project management, and software development practices.

## About the Author
This repository is maintained by Tianyang. I am a student of programming II(CP1404), continuously improving my coding skills through practical assignments and challenges.

## Key Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- **Readability Matters**: Writing code that is easy to read and understand is crucial for collaboration and future maintenance.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each function or class should have a single, well-defined purpose.
- **Iterative Development**: Breaking tasks into smaller, testable steps ensures steady progress and minimizes bugs.

## Projects Included
### 1. Programming Languages
- Files: `language_file_reader.py`, `programming_language.py`, `languages.csv`
- Description: Reads and processes data about programming languages, demonstrating file handling, object-oriented programming, and data manipulation.

### 2. Guitar Management
- Files: `guitar.py`, `myguitars.py`, `guitars.csv`
- Description: Manages a collection of guitars, including sorting by year, adding new guitars, and saving to a file.

### 3. Project Management Program
- Files: `project.py`, `project_management.py`, `projects.txt`
- Description: A menu-driven application for managing projects, supporting functionality like loading, saving, filtering, and updating projects.

## Acknowledgments
These projects are part of the CP1404 Practical Assignments, which emphasize good programming practices and clean code development.
